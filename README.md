# Curvs
A "minimalist", fully configurable, Rainmeter launcher

Idea from [this](https://redd.it/3wd6yp) reddit discussion.

Special thanks to [@JuanPotato](https://github.com/juanpotato) for improvments and images


# Installation
* Install Rainmeter from [here](https://www.rainmeter.net/). Download the .rmskin file from [here](https://github.com/eyezis/Curvs/blob/master/Curvs_2.44.rmskin?raw=true) and double click it to install it.
* After the installation, you should edit `Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\Curvs\@resources\Variables.inc`

The Variables.inc file that comes with the skin should be enough to learn how to add/remove rings/sections/programs from the launcher. 
If you run into problems, message/tag me on reddit. I am /u/EyeZiS there too.

For more information on the configuration file see the [wiki](https://github.com/eyezis/Curvs/wiki).
