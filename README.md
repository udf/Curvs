# Curvs
A "minimalist", fully configurable, Rainmeter launcher

Idea from [this](https://redd.it/3wd6yp) reddit discussion.

Special thanks to [@JuanPotato](https://github.com/juanpotato) for improvments and images


# Installation
* Install Rainmeter from [here](https://www.rainmeter.net/). Download the .rmskin file from [here](https://github.com/eyezis/Curvs/blob/master/Curvs_2.41.rmskin?raw=true) and double click it to install it.
* After the installation, you should edit `Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\Curvs\@resources\Variables.inc`

The Variables.inc file that comes with the skin should be enough to learn how to add/remove rings/sections/programs from the launcher. I'll add some documentation to the wiki on this repository as people run into problems.
